	<h3>About MMOWGLI</h3>
	<p>Play the game, change the game!</p>
	<p>
		<strong>MMOWGLI stands for Massive Multiplayer Online Wargame
			Leveraging the Internet.&nbsp;</strong> It is a message-based game to
		encourage innovative thinking by many people, connected via the Web.
		It has been used to study a number of topics, such as how the Navy can
		prepare for the future of energy......starting in 2021 and beyond.<br />
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a
			href="http://www.onr.navy.mil/en/Science-Technology/Directorates/office-innovation/mmowgli-internet-war-game.aspx ">
			MMOWGLI project</a> was originally sponsored by the <a
			href="http://www.onr.navy.mil "> Office of Naval Research (ONR)</a>
		for the <a href="http://www.navy.mil "> United States Navy</a>. The
		goal of the project is to explore the potential of a Massively
		Multiplayer Online War Game Leveraging the Internet (MMOWGLI), with a
		variety of themes, to expand engagement in military and non-military
		strategy development for complex geopolitical problems. The platform
		is designed to support large numbers of distributed global players
		working together on idea generation and action planning, with an eye
		towards surfacing innovative outlier strategies. Several dozen games,
		workshops and courses have used the MMOWGLI platform.<br />

		<strong>A focus on the future of piracy.&nbsp;</strong> The second and
		third MMOWGLI games picked up where the original MMOWGLI pilot left
		off. We focused on the Gulf of Aden through 2021 but very quickly
		transition to some possible future piracy hot spots: providing
		&#034;Recovery and Resilience&#034; in the South Pacific in the wake
		of climate change, and responding to the unprecedented &#034;resource
		grab&#034; that could happen during the first ever ice free Arctic
		summer. Each of these represented a so-called &#034;wicked
		problem&#034; in which complexity and uncertainty make it difficult to
		arrive at simple solutions. Complex economic, social, military and
		political considerations are acted out by diverse players. From the
		pirates themselves to shipping companies to foreign navies and
		international institutions, the diversity of interests and
		perspectives will challenge future solutions, military or otherwise.

		<strong>A focus on the future of energy use.&nbsp;</strong> Our second
		major game was <a
			href="http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=63277 ">
			Energy MMOWGLI</a> which brought together players to consider how to
		reduce the heavy reliance by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps on a
		finite, expensive and unreliable supply of fossil fuels. This
		dependency degrades our strategic position and the tactical
		performance of our forces. The global supply of oil is finite, it is
		increasingly difficult to find, and cost continues to rise. We need to
		improve our <a href="http://greenfleet.dodlive.mil "> energy
			security</a>, increase our energy independence, and help lead the nation
		towards a clean energy economy. Among other themes, we plan to examine
		the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/features/Navy_EnergySecurity.pdf ">
			Navy Energy Security Strategy</a> and consider Energy Efficient
		Acquisition, Sail the &#034;Great Green Fleet,&#034; Reduce
		Non-Tactical Petroleum Use, Increase Alternative Energy Ashore, and
		Increase Alternative Energy Use DON-Wide. Please <a
			href="https://secure.onr.navy.mil/energymmowgli "> register</a> to
		sign up and be notified when we launch the Energy MMOWGLI game.

		<strong>A new kind of war game.&nbsp;</strong> These characteristics
		call for a new kind of war game that can engage diverse players from
		across many organizations and ranks, both in the United States and
		beyond. In fact, this kind of war game can even engage the educated
		public in an arena that has traditionally been reserved for a limited
		elite. The future strategies for situations like we see in MMOWGLI
		will play out in an environment where players can rapidly communicate
		across boundaries, self-organize in ad hoc online networks, and share
		a wide variety of media and resources to influence decisions. MMOWGLI
		is designed to guide strategy development in this context.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>A collaborative effort.&nbsp;</strong> MMOWGLI was jointly
		designed by <a href="http://www.iftf.org "> Institute for the
			Future (IFTF)</a> and developed by the <a href="http://www.nps.edu ">
			Naval Postgraduate School (NPS)</a>. IFTF expanded the goals of its
		earlier gaming platforms, Signtific Lab and Foresight Engine,
		designing extensions that create a robust multimedia environment for
		collaborative strategic planning by networks of people who may be
		complete strangers. NPS drew on its broad knowledge of worldwide Naval
		operations as well as its deep capacity in computer science to develop
		this new gaming software using a Web-based architecture, building an
		open-source platform that can test the limits of new online
		environments. NPS continues to maintain and extend the codebase.
		Interested stakeholders are welcome to contribute to these efforts.<br />
