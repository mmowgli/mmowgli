	<h2>What is the difference between the MMOWGLI game and the
		MMOWGLI portal?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="font-size: larger">MMOWGLI is an online
				game that calls forth the combined imagination of the Navy's members
				and other public players.&nbsp; Game play generates insight into
				complex, difficult, real-world challenges.&nbsp; The MMOWGLI game
				runs in any Web browser on a personal computer or laptop. In
				addition, you can now find MMOWGLI support through mobile devices
				such as an iPad.</span></li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="font-size: larger">The MMOWGLI portal
				(this website) is a separate supporting collection of information
				resources to help individuals learn more about individual game
				topics.&nbsp; In addition, the portal is home to the MMOWGLI Blog,
				an online blog associated with each individual MMOWGLI game.</span></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>How does someone play the MMOWGLI game?</h2>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: larger">Essentially the MMOWGLI game
			enables players to cooperate and brainstorm different ideas.&nbsp;
			Game players can post ideas, and then respond with other ideas that
			build, counter, redirect or call for further expertise.&nbsp; Each
			idea posted is labeled a "card" and points are earned based on their
			influence and perceived value. This brainstorming occurs within the
			Web browser via a high-quality user interface.&nbsp; No prior
			software downloads or installations are required, since the game can
			run in any Web browser connected to the Internet.</span>
	</p>
	<h2>What else can happen after playing lots of cards?</h2>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: larger">Groups of players can build
			extensive "card chains" forming larger sets of ideas and
			concepts.&nbsp; Game Masters help to moderate and encourage progress
			among players.&nbsp; Individuals contributing to particularly
			intriguing concepts are then invited to work collaboratively on an
			"Action Plan" contribution, or players may initiate an Action Plan
			request should they feel compelled to do so.&nbsp; Each Action Plan
			helps authors focus on clearly illustrating the "<em>who</em>, <em>what</em>,
			<em>when</em>, <em>where</em>, <em>why</em>, and <em>how</em>" of
			their idea.&nbsp; Player support is also provided to facilitate
			telling their story with images, video clips and annotated
			maps.&nbsp; Published action plans are awarded further points by all
			players providing ratings (0 to 3 "thumbs up") and additional
			comments.
		</span>
	</p>
	<h2>How do I know what to say in the game?</h2>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: larger">Players are first challenged by
			'Call to Action' videos that define the critical problems being
			tackled in each move of the game.&nbsp; Many people are playing, each
			with lots of different expertise.&nbsp; Reach out and ask for help
			when that might improve the value of your group's ideas.&nbsp; In
			many cases, asking the right questions is just as important as
			offering helpful answers.&nbsp; Someone else might be wondering about
			the same thing.&nbsp; Say what you think!&nbsp; Often there is
			"wisdom in the crowd" as we together work our way through hard
			problems together.&nbsp; Your point of view is important.</span>
	</p>
	<h2>How do I 'win' the game?</h2>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: larger"><strong>You do not
				earn points for posting a card - you earn points when others react
				to your ideas</strong>. </span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: larger">The point-scoring algorithm
			gives <em>Exploration Points</em> for other peoples' reactions to
			your
		</span><span style="font-size: larger">idea cards.&nbsp; You also
			get&nbsp;<em>Implementation Points</em> for&nbsp;Action Plan
			contributions.&nbsp; Game Masters can also mark players ideas as <em>Super
				Interesting </em>when they appear to hold particular promise.&nbsp; The <em>Leaderboard
		</em>shows who has the most points in the game -- in other words, who is
			most effective and influential.&nbsp; Positions are likely to change
			rapidly as we innovate together!
		</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: larger">Many awards are computed
			automatically - see your player profile to see them.&nbsp; The
			MMOWGLI design team will consider additional awards for the best
			contributions after each move of the game.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: larger">After the game, the best
			ideas&nbsp; and concepts are considered for adoption&nbsp;by the
			Office of Naval Research (ONR) and other Navy stakeholders.&nbsp;
			There is no telling how far your influence might reach!</span>
	</p>
