		<span> How to Create a MMOWGLI Game Account </span>
	</h3>

	<p>
		Welcome. &nbsp;We are keen to have you login and play MMOWGLI.
		&nbsp;To create a new player account, please select the <em>I'm
			New to MMOWGLI</em>&nbsp;button.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img
			alt="creating an account: select I'm New to MMOWGLI"
			src="openingScreen.png"
			height="361" width="600" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;">
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;">Sometimes the MMOWGLI game is
			public, other times access&nbsp;is controlled&nbsp;by
			invitation.&nbsp; If a game is by invitation, we will want previously
			approved email addresses on a VIP list.&nbsp; If that is not working
			for you, please send us a <a
			href="https://portal.mmowgli.nps.edu/trouble">Trouble Report</a>.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;">When you first enter the game
			page, there are two options. If you are a new user,&nbsp; please
			select the left-side text "I'm new to MMOWGLI" to begin the
			registration process. If you already have an existing account in this
			game, please select "I'm registered".</span>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <img alt="User Agreement One"
			src="userAgreement.png"
			height="410" width="600">
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;">You will be asked to read and
			accept the <a
			href="termsAndConditions.html">Terms
				and Conditions</a>, which are two user agreements. If you agree to these
			conditions, which protect the privacy of players in the
			game,&nbsp;then&nbsp;please "accept and continue."&nbsp; If not then
			please click "reject, no thanks."
		</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<img alt="Registration One"
			src="registrationOne.png"
			height="663" width="600">
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;">In this area you will be asked
			to input information that the game will need to create your account.
			At any point you can close this registration window by left-clicking
			"Cancel" at right top of the box.&nbsp; Of course, doing so will
			abort the process and any registration information you entered will
			not be saved.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;">The first box titled "We don't
			need much to get your playing the game", asks for the email address
			you want associated with your MMOWGLI. You are also required to
			create a unique user name which will be used as your identification
			within the game. After deciding on your game password, please provide
			it in the fields labeled "Password" and "Confirm Password".</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;">The last required field on this
			screen is where you are asked to select an "Avatar" image. This will
			become the image associated with your user name and will show as an
			icon next to it on most pages of the game. Once you have completed
			all of the steps above, please select "continue" at the bottom to
			move to the next screen.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong><span style="font-size: larger">Registration
				Errors</span></strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<img alt=""
			src="registrationError.png"
			height="74" width="600">
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;">If you see this error then
			please re-enter a password of the approriate length. If you are still
			getting registration errors, please file a <a
			href="https://portal.mmowgli.nps.edu/trouble" target="_blank">Trouble
				Report</a>.
		</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Tell Us About
				You</strong></span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<img alt=""
			src="tellAboutYou.png"
			height="253" width="600">
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;">On the "Tell us about you"
			screen you have the option of telling us about yourself. If you
			left-click on arrow pointing downward next just right of the
			Affiliation field, you can select your affiliation. The options here
			are Non-Profit/NGO, Academic, Military, Government, Industry, Media,
			or other. After selecting the option that you feel best describes
			you, you will then be asked to input your location. Once you have
			entered the information needed above, please left-click "continue".</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<img alt="Registration Three"
			src="tellOthers.png"
			height="473" width="600">
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;">You will now be on a screen that
			says "Last Step" at the top of the box. In this screen, you will be
			asked to input a short description of your pertinent expertise. You
			will also be asked a counter-piracy trivia question. Upon completion
			of this please left-click "Get a briefing". This will complete your
			registration and now you're ready to being game play.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: #b22222;">Note</span>:
			Depending on what stage of development you may or may not be able to
			join. You will be prompted with this information upon completion of
			registration and your information will be saved.</span>
