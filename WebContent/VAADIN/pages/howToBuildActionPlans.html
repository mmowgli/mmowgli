	<h2>How to Build Action Plans&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>Once long card chains start to emerge, the gamemasters may
		invite you to Take Action. That means three things: authoring action
		plans, reviewing them, and rating them. These are good ways to rack up
		Innovation Points, so you can watch your score soar!</p>
	<h2>Becoming&nbsp;an author</h2>
	<p>There are several ways to become an author on an action
		plan.&nbsp; You must either be</p>
	<p>(a) You can be included on the original action-plan
		invitation.&nbsp; Initial invitations are&nbsp;built by a game master
		from an interesting card chain.</p>
	<p>
		(b) You can be invited by one of the other authors of the action
		plan.&nbsp; Authors can be contacted via the action-plan public
		comments envelope or by in-game email (if they opted in). (Follow
		these steps: <a
			href="actionPlanStep1.png">Step
			1</a>, <a
			href="actionPlanStep2.png">Step
			2</a>, <a
			href="actionPlanStep3.png">Step
			3</a>.)
	</p>
	<p>
		(c) You can ask to create a new action plan via an <a
			href="http://portal.mmowgli.nps.edu/action-plan-request">Action
			Plan Request</a> at <a
			href="http://portal.mmowgli.nps.edu/action-plan-request">http://portal.mmowgli.nps.edu/action-plan-request</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		(d) You can request help from a game master via a <a
			href="http://%20http://portal.mmowgli.nps.edu/trouble">Trouble
			Report</a> at <a href="http://%20http://portal.mmowgli.nps.edu/trouble">http://portal.mmowgli.nps.edu/trouble</a>.&nbsp;
		Game masters can ask authors for you or provide other advice.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>So you're an author...</h2>
	<p>It's an important honor—and responsibility—to receive an
		invitation to author an Action Plan.&nbsp; Here is what an Action Plan
		display looks like:</p>
	<p>
		<img alt="" src="actionPlanDisplay.png"
			style="width: 912px; height: 549px;">
	</p>
	<p>There is a lot of information here!&nbsp; You can choose to view
		the original card chain, view the most recent comment, and view who
		the authors are.&nbsp; Author whose names are in parentheses are
		pending - they have not yet accepted the invitation to author.</p>
	<p>
		Confirmed authors and Game Masters can select the <strong>ADD
			AUTHOR </strong>button to invite new authors to join&nbsp;the Action Plan.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each Action Plan originates from a chain of idea cards. Take a look at
		the original card chain and then "Talk It Over" with your co-authors
		in the online chat. If your co-authors are busy or in another time
		zone, go ahead and start filling out the plan. They can all jump in
		and edit it later. Tell the story. <em>This is the heart of
			action planning</em>. Capture the essence of&nbsp;the plan&nbsp;in the
		headline, then explain the <em>what</em>, <em>how</em>, and <em>why
		</em>of this plan.&nbsp;You can further illuststrate what you mean with
		images, videos, and map annotations.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<h3>Style Guide</h3>
	<p>Authors: please spell all words fully for searchability and
		clarity.&nbsp; Abbreviations can be confusing - and you no longer have
		the 140-character limit to deal with in Action Plan entries.</p>
	<p>Please also format your prose as simple paragraphs since (a) the
		action-plan report output is formatted as plain text HTML, and (b)
		"bullet" punctuation (hyphens etc.) will be --interspersed and
		--confusing.</p>
	<h2>Action Plan Author Chat</h2>
	<p>In the Action Plan tab for Author Chat, authors can discuss the
		details of their plan. Please note that other players&nbsp;cannot use
		or see the shared author chat while in the game - but it is published
		later as part of the game report.</p>
	<p>If you want to communicate privately with a single author, the
		best bet is to send them email via the game.&nbsp; Each player's
		profile page shows whether they receive in-game mail, regular email,
		both, or no mail at all..</p>
	<p>Public feedback for all authors (and everybody else) can be
		added to the "comments envelope" at&nbsp;the bottom of the Action
		Plan.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<img alt="" src="actionPlanChat.png"
			style="width: 914px; height: 409px;">
	</p>
	<h2>Action Plan Images</h2>
	<p>In this tab you can add a new image via web address, upload a
		new image of your own, replace an existing image, or else delete a
		prior&nbsp;image.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also edit the title and
		caption of each image.&nbsp; Click on the correct buttons to perform
		the task you want.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<img alt="" src="actionPlanImages.png"
			style="width: 919px; height: 577px;">
	</p>
	<h3>Adding Action Plan Video</h3>
	<p>In this tab you can&nbsp;add a link to a
		YouTube&nbsp;video.&nbsp; You can also edit the title and caption of
		each video.</p>
	<p>
		<img alt="" src="actionPlanVideos.png"
			style="width: 926px; height: 470px;">
	</p>
	<h3>Adding and Annotating&nbsp;a Map for your Plan</h3>
	<p>
		<img alt="" src="actionPlanMap.png"
			style="width: 928px; height: 557px;">
	</p>
	<p>Each Action Plan includes a map section which you can edit.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Pick the right location in the world that helps to illustrate
			your plan.&nbsp; Save that location.</li>
		<li>Drag and drop a marker&nbsp;icon to a particular
			location.&nbsp; Add or edit some text to describe
			why&nbsp;that&nbsp;location&nbsp;is significant.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>We're planning on building additional map support.&nbsp; Future
		features will include adding or saving KML map annotations, including
		maps in output reports, map&nbsp;captions, hiding, etc.</p>
	<p>
		We are currently using&nbsp;<a href="http://leafletjs.com/"><font
			color="#0066cc">Leaflet</font></a> for maximum portability on all
		browsers.&nbsp; You can separately use other map tools to create
		images for your Action Plan.
	</p>

		<li><a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/features.html">NASA
				World Wind</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Finding a Plan to Work On</h2>
	<p>If you don't get an invitation to author, you can search a list
		of action plans that need authors on the Action Plan Dashboard.</p>
	<p>
		<img alt="" src="actionPlanDashboard.png"
			style="width: 918px; height: 394px;">
	</p>
	<p>View the details of any action plan by clicking on its row to
		select it.</p>
	<h2>Review, review, review!</h2>
	<p>Whether you're author or not, you can build your own Innovation
		Points by commenting on action plans of others. You get points for
		every constructive comment, and your comments will help the
		gamemasters choose the winning action plans. (But watch out! If you
		add meaningless comments just to get points, gamemasters may mark the
		comment UNCONSTRUCTIVE, and you'll lose your points—and your
		reputation.)</p>
	<p>

			style="width: 923px; height: 395px;">
	</p>
	<p>Check out the opportunities to score big here.</p>
	<p>Rate every action plan! As a game move draws to a close, you'll
		see the thumbs-up rating come to life. You can give action plans one,
		two, or three thumbs up. Here's how to rate them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Zero thumbs:&nbsp; </strong>no vote.</li>
		<li><strong>One thumb</strong>: A well-thought out plan that
			could make a difference but perhaps lacks all the details and
			supporting media to make it really compelling and complete.</li>
		<li><strong>Two thumbs</strong>: A strong plan with lots of
			details, including images, video, or map annotations.</li>
		<li><strong>Three thumbs</strong>: A breakthrough plan that uses
			a winning combination of innovative resources, unexpected alliances,
			and far-sighted strategy to break the stalemate—with images, video,
			or map annotations that bring the story to life</li>
	</ul>
	<p>

			to Win with Action Plans</a> video.
	</p>
	<p>Remember, not every move in a game always includes Action Plan
		creation. You'll know action plans are available two ways: if you get
		an invitation to author an action plan, and if the Take Action button
		at the top of every page is active.</p>
