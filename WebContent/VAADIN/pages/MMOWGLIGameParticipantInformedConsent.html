        <p>

            <b>Introduction.</b>  You are invited to participate in a research study entitled 
            <i>MMOWGLI:  Massive Multiplayer Online War Game Leveraging the Internet.</i>
            This game is maintained online at 
            <a href="http://mmowgli.nps.edu">http://mmowgli.nps.edu</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            MMOWGLI is an online game that calls forth the combined imagination of the Navy's members and stakeholders, generating insight into complex, difficult, real-world challenges. This game platform is designed to elicit collective intelligence from an engaged pool of players to solve real-world problems.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Procedures.</b>  The game allows players from the inside and outside the Navy to examine questions regarding how to defend against Somali piracy.  Participation is voluntary.  Identities are kept anonymous although some players may independently choose to identify themselves.  Participants also have the option to reveal their professional affiliation (such as U.S. Navy, NGO etc.) and geographic location if that might help them to collaborate.  Participants must assert that they are at least 18 years of age.

        </p>
        <p>
            The project will record all player responses in order to play the game properly.  These responses also allow the research team to consider how social-networking techniques can be most effective for group collaboration, to determine possible ways to improve the usefulness of the game software, and to identify possible avenues for future collaborative activity or research.

        </p>
        <p>
            Detailed instructions are provided as part of the game, which occurs over multiple moves.  Each move includes brainstorming by &quot;playing a card&quot; that posts your ideas and reactions, optionally followed by the creation of an &quot;action plan&quot; which describes a team&apos;s ideas in detail.  Specifically, players are asked to
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>	Provide minimal identifying information that includes characterizing relevant expertise for possible teaming and collaboration</li>
            <li>	Review videos providing a "Call to Action" that focuses their efforts</li>
            <li>	Review cards with ideas from other players that explore how the Navy might better adapt or act to solve difficult challenges</li>
            <li>	Post cards that contribute your own new ideas or react constructively to already-posted ideas</li>
            <li>	Collaborate on writing Action Plans that describe emergent concepts in more detail</li>
            <li>	Experiment with simple predefined simulations that help illustrate nonlinear relationships between cost and effectiveness</li>
            <li>	Optionally you can use any external resource to help inform your ideas</li>
            <li>	Optionally you may complete a voluntary survey after each round or phase of a game</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Everyone plays the same game:  there are no new, experimental or untested procedures.  The game is purely a research experiment sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  Some ideas presented during card play and action-plan creation may lead to invitations for further study or investigation following the game.  Game play is typically available 24 hours per day for three days, repeated over several weeks. Participants may plan the game for any length of time while game play is open.  We expect most people will play 30 minutes to 2 hours per day, likely across several sessions as game dialog progresses.

        </p>
        <p>
            A user can send email to another user in the game, but no disclosure of Personal Identifying Information (PII) or original email address is disclosed.  Users can continue to communicate via the game, or independently choose to reveal their actual identity.  No recording of email messages occurs.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Voluntary Nature of the Study.</b>  Your participation in this study is strictly voluntary.  If you choose to participate you can change your mind at any time and withdraw from the study. You will not be penalized in any way or lose any benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled if you choose not to participate in this study or to withdraw.

        </p>
        <p>
            Participation in past MMOWGLI games has been determined to be consistent with official Navy duties by the President of the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) and the Chief of Naval Research (CNR).  
            Nevertheless individual players must request approval of their local Commanding Officer (CO) prior to game play during working hours or if using government equipment.  
            Prior permission is optional for players participating during their own free time.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Potential Risks and Discomforts.</b> The potential risks of participating in this study are minimal.  No physical, psychological, social, or economic risks are anticipated.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>	All player comments are restricted to the game and only visible to other players.  </li>
            <li>	Participants in the game are encouraged to maintain their privacy, in order to minimize the risk of possible identification by game players outside the Navy with potentially malevolent intent.  </li>
            <li>	Be careful that the combination of your game ID, service affiliation and geographic location does not consist of Personal Identifying Information (PII) or reveal your actual real-world identity.</li>
            <li>	Player discussions are designed to be constructive.  Personal attacks are not allowed.</li>
            <li>	Player contact with other players is mediated via the game.  If a player wants to also share their email address or contact information with another player, they must send a direct message that provides it.</li>
            <li>	Some player contributions may be published (anonymously, without attribution) as part of post-game reports and articles.</li>
            <li>	All participants must agree to not disclose any sensitive or classified information whatsoever.  Failure to observe this requirement may lead to separate investigations and potentially adverse administrative actions against a player.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you observe or encounter any difficulty, please report problems to the Game Moderators</a> so that we can remedy it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Anticipated Benefits.</b>  There are several anticipated benefits from this study.  Individuals are expected to benefit by learning more about a difficult problem and collaborating with others who have complementary expertise.  Some players may be officially recognized for their contributions.  However, aside from the possibility of achieving greater knowledge and understanding, you will not directly benefit from your participation in this research.

        </p>
        <p>
            The game also allows the Navy and Department of Defense (DoD) to foresee and collaborate on larger and more imaginative possibilities than is currently possible. With conventional methods of encouraging the generation of new insights, facilitating and aggregating cooperative collaboration at this level of breadth and depth is prohibitively difficult.  
            At the end of each game we have improved a lightweight, repurposable game engine that other Navy commands and services can also use to tackle their own tough questions and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Compensation for Participation.</b>  No tangible compensation will be given for your participation.  A copy of the research results will be available at the conclusion of the experiment, with publication details provided on the project website.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Confidentiality & Privacy Act.</b>  
            Any Personal Identifying Information (PII) that is obtained during this study will be kept confidential to the full extent permitted by law. 
            All efforts, within reason, will be made to keep your personal information in your research record confidential but total confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. 
            Industry-wide best practices and Navy information assurance (IA) requirements govern the digital storage and privacy requirements for recorded information.  
            However, it remains possible that the researcher may be required to divulge information obtained in the course of this research to the subject&apos;s chain of command or other legal body.
            Thus players are again cautioned to avoid unacceptable behavior such as disclosure of sensitive information, exposing anyone&apos;s Personal Identifying Information (PII), personal attacks, etc.
